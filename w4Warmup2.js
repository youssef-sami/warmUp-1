// 1. Create a HTML file, add 3 text fields to it next to each other, 1 button below them, 1 headline below the button
// 2. Create a JS file and connect it to the HTML
// 3. Create a CSS file and link it to the HTML
// 4. Create a function in the JS file that takes a number from the first and the third text fields and takes (+, -, *, /) from the second text field, then it calculates the operation and changes the headline to the result.
// 5. The function should change the color of the headline to green if the result is smaller than 100, to blue if itâ€™s equal to or larger than 100 and to red if the input in the first or the third text fields is not a number and if the second text field is not one of the 4 operations (wrong inputs)
// 6. Style the HTML elements in the CSS file as you see fit and center them in the webpage
